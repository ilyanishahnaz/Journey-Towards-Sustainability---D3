## Project Overview
As globalisation progresses, our planet faces significant environmental and socio-economic challenges. Increased industrial activity and urban expansion have escalated global energy demand, with fossil fuels being the primary source. This reliance on non-renewable energy exacerbates climate change, air pollution, and resource depletion. Fossil fuel consumption also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, intensifying extreme weather events and polluting ecosystems. To mitigate these issues, promoting sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro power is essential. These alternatives emit minimal greenhouse gases and reduce reliance on finite fossil fuels.

## Project Objective
This project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard analysing global sustainable energy data sourced from Kaggle. The dataset covers the years 2000 to 2020, but the focus is on data up to 2019 due to incomplete 2020 records. By examining global sustainable energy trends, the project seeks to uncover patterns and challenges across regions.

### Key Questions:
- Are countries financially capable of supporting green technology, and if so, are they prioritising it?
- How have countries developed energy infrastructure for renewable energy over time?
- What are the sources of electricity in different countries, and what is the ratio of renewable to non-renewable energy consumption?

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard offers various interactive visualisations to help users explore global data on sustainable energy. It provides an intuitive experience for analysing key trends, with features including:

- **Map Visualization**: Displays countries with access to clean fuels and electricity, alongside population density measured in persons per square kilometre (P/kmÂ²).
- **Electricity Generation Charts**: Illustrates the amounts of electricity generated from nuclear, fossil fuels, and renewable energy sources.
- **Energy Consumption Charts**: Shows total final energy consumption, differentiating between renewable and non-renewable sources.
- **Top Renewable Energy Consumers**: Highlights the top five countries that consume the most renewable energy.
- **Financial Aid Recipients**: Lists the top countries receiving financial aid for clean energy projects.
- **Renewable Energy Share vs. GDP**: Compares renewable energy consumption per capita with GDP per capita, showing if financially capable countries prioritise renewable energy.
- **Annual Trends in Renewable Energy Share**: Displays year-over-year trends in renewable energy share, showing progress over time.

This project provides an analytical tool to understand global sustainable energy trends and supports efforts to transition towards a greener future.
